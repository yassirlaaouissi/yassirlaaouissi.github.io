title: "Mid OSCP Update"
category: OSCP

Hello ladies and gentleman, today I decided to do an update on how the PWK/OSCP is going. I just finished 11 boxes which are part of the Offensive Security PWK learning path (https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050473812). They seemed easier then I thought, maybe it was because I had some HackTheBox experience beforehand, maybe not. I made notes on those machines, but unfortunately I may not share them. Though I may give tips without spoiling the bunch. So feel free to reach out to me.

## Whats next

I have around 50 days left of PWK labs, so far I have been doing machines 1 by 1 every day. I think I am going to get my rhythm up to OSCP exam standards, which means doing 5 boxes a day at the end of my lab time. This week i'll start doing 2 boxes per day, the week after that 3 boxes a day, then 4, then 5. I think this will take me around a month of my labtime to get this rhythm. The last 20 days I will focus a bit more on the report and buffer overflows I think.

## Final note

I have been using my enumeration tool EZEA (https://github.com/yassirlaaouissi/EZEA), and so far I am not disappointed I spent time on it. If anyone has suggestions on how to make this tool better, or on how to practice buffer overflows, please do tell me. Have a nice day!
